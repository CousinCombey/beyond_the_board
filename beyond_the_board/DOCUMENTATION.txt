17. FEN POSITIONS (40 columns)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) strings represent the exact board position.
There are 40 FEN columns capturing positions at 10 different game stages:

For each stage (opening, early, developing, pre_mid, midgame, post_mid,
transition, late, pre_end, endgame), there are 4 columns:

fen_[stage]_white
  What it is: Board position when white is about to move
  Format: Special chess notation describing all pieces
  Example: "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1"

fen_[stage]_black
  What it is: Board position when black is about to move

move_[stage]_white
  What it is: Which move this position corresponds to (white's turn)

move_[stage]_black
  What it is: Which move this position corresponds to (black's turn)

Purpose of FEN strings:
- Recreate exact board positions
- Feed into neural networks for position analysis
- Visualize positions using chess software
- Analyze with chess engines

The 10 stages captured:
1. opening (around move 5)
2. early (around move 8)
3. developing (around move 12)
4. pre_mid (around move 16)
5. midgame (around move 20)
6. post_mid (around move 24)
7. transition (around move 28)
8. late (around move 32)
9. pre_end (around move 36)
10. endgame (final position)
